# Self-Analysis-Mental-Health-Model
A machine learning-based mental health prediction tool that analyzes survey responses to assess the likelihood of requiring mental health treatment.

# Features:

ML Models: Random Forest & Logistic Regression for classification
Explainability: SHAP for feature importance analysis
LLM Integration: Uses T5 Transformer for AI-driven explanations
Interactive UI: Gradio-based web interface for easy self-assessment

# How It Works:
Input survey responses related to mental health.
The model predicts the need for mental health treatment.
SHAP provides feature contributions, and T5 generates an AI-based explanation.

# Dataset Preprocessing Steps
The dataset (survey.csv) contains survey responses, and we perform the following preprocessing steps:

**Data Cleaning:**
Remove missing values using dropna().

**Label Encoding:**
Convert categorical variables (like text labels) to numeric labels using LabelEncoder() for machine learning compatibility.
Feature and Target Variable:

The features are all columns except treatment.
The target variable is the treatment column, which indicates the mental health condition.

**Train-Test Split:**
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio. Stratified sampling ensures balanced distribution of labels in both sets.

# Model Selection Rationale

**Random Forest Classifier**

Random Forest is chosen because:

1) It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees, offering improved accuracy and robustness.
2) It handles missing data, categorical variables, and multicollinearity well.
3) It provides feature importance, making it suitable for this problem.
   
**T5 for Explanation Generation**
1) T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is used to generate explanations for predictions made by the model.
2) The T5 model generates a human-readable explanation based on the predicted condition (label) derived from the Random Forest model.

# How to Run the Inference Script

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, joblib, seaborn, matplotlib, shap, torch, transformers, gradio Install them using pip
**pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost joblib seaborn matplotlib shap torch transformers gradio**

# UI/CLI Usage Instructions

**Using the Gradio UI:**

Launch the Web Interface:

-> Running the script will open a Gradio web interface where you can input survey data.

-> The UI will display the predicted mental health condition along with an explanation generated by the T5 model.

**Using the CLI:**

-> The model can also be used in a command-line interface if you want to bypass the Gradio UI.
-> Simply load the model and call predict_mental_health function with the appropriate inputs.


# Conclusion
This project blends machine learning predictive modelling with natural language generation to provide reasoning. The outcome serves as a source of knowledge for mental health practitioners and researchers-a guide for them to comprehend the chats and reasons why a mental health predictor provides certain predictions based on the survey data.
